# 611-HW
This file is for the git basics assignment. 
I don't really know what my project is yet, but I'd like to do something in the realm of biostat. I found some data about patients who had strokes. A bunch of other covariates were measured, and I'd like to maybe do some inference on what factors are significant. Its from kaggle, so the norm is to not do any inference at all and just build a predictive model, which I could also try.
